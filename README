Introduction
------------

xfpgenius is a backend program that compares a reference circuit against 
a database of circuits inorder to find similar circuits. It will monitor 
the status of the reference circuit and any changes made to the reference 
circuit will invoke a new comparison. This variation compares the circuit
functionally.


Running xfpgenius
-----------------

To run xfpgenius simply execute the following command

$ ./xfpgenius <path to reference> <path to database> <path to primitives>


Database File
-------------

The database file contains a list of circuits to be compared with the 
reference. It gives a list of the paths of where the function of the 
circuit is extracted. Function of circuit can only have 1 output.
Must currently split the circuit to derive another functional output. 


Circuit Format
----------------

4                  Number of Gates
2 0 IN1 1 IN2      Number of inputs followed by the IN|IN Port
0 IN 0  1 2 O      VIndex|Type|Num In|Ins|In Ports|Num Out|Outs|Out Port
1 IN 0  1 2 O
2 AND 2 0 A 1 B  1 3 O
3 INV 1 2 A  0


Primitive Format
----------------

4                  Number of Gates
2 0 IN1 1 IN2      Number of inputs followed by the IN|In Port
