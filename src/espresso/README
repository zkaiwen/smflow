This distribution is just a reworked version of the c. 1989 Berkeley
espresso source code.  All I've done is cut the number of files down
to just what is required for a modern POSIXy OS and made those files
more ISO-C compliant.  This should make building espresso a little
easier in these more standards compliant times.

See the file COPYING for the original code licence.  All kudos to the
original authors.

To compile espresso, type:
	./configure
	make

The source file is called espresso located in the src/ folder.

INPUT/OUTPUT FILES

Here is a sample input file. If this file is run w/o removing the comments they will end up in the output, otherwise it will work as shown below.

.i 4	       	# .i specifies the number of inputs 
.o 3       # .o specifies the number of outputs 
.ilb Q1 Q0 D N     	# This line specifies the names of the inputs in order 
.ob T1 T0 OPEN  	# This line specifies the names of the outputs in order 
0011 ---      #The first four digits (before the space) correspond 
0101 110   	# to the inputs, the three after the space correspond 
0110 100   	# to the outputs, both in order specified above. 
0001 010 
0010 100 
0111 --- 
1001 010 
1010 010 
1011 --- 
1100 001 
1101 001 
1110 001 
1111 --- 
.e	      	# Signifies the end of the file.

In the output set the -'s represent don't cares. You only need to specify those input combinations which produce a one in one of the outputs. Lines which are skipped are assumed to be zeroes on the outputs.

When running espresso a basic command line is:

espresso inputfile

Output File
.i 4 
.o 3 
.ilb Q1 Q0 D N 
.ob T1 T0 OPEN 
.p 5 
0-1- 100 
101- 010 
11-- 001 
-0-1 010 
01-1 110 
.e

The first four lines are the same as the input file. The fifth line specifies how many product terms were created following the header. Left set of numbers on each of the subsequent lines specifies the inputs for a given product term. Each digit represents one of the inputs in the order specified on the ".ilb" line. "0"'s represent inverted inputs and "1"'s represent non-inverted inputs, "-" represent inputs which are not used in a given product term. I.e., in the first line "0-1-" represents (!Q1&D)
